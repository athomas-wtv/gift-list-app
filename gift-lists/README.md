# Gift Lists
## Introduction
First and foremost this is a personal project app. It's not currently in the cards for me to make this a production app for millions of users
but hey...it could happen.

The function of this web app is to allow users to create gift lists for various holidays that call for gifts (birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, etc.). Users
will be able to create different lists for different occations. Within those lists, users will add an item object, add it's title, and the link to where one 
could purchase it online. The user will then be able to email or text a link to friends and family so that they can read the list the purchase exactly what
the person wants.

The front end of this project is written in ReactJS. I choose this language because it's a very marketable skill to have. I currenly don't know it so,
through this app, I am teaching myself. If it's not added yet at the time you're reading this, I will be adding Redux for state management, Axios to make http calls,
and Material UI for design. MD UI will be added last. My main goal right now is to get the functionality in place because my personality tends to get
hung up on the looks which can hinder progress.

### Disclaimer
Much of the front end code is sloppy and thrown together for the sake of getting the functionality working. Don't judge me :)

### Todo List

The back end API is .NET Core. I choose this because it's also marketable and I've only used it throughout my short dev career. I have grown to really like it.

I will be using entity framework merely to talk to the database. At this point, I won't be using migrations.

## Database

The DB Management system I'm using is MySQL. I've worked in MSSQL and T-SQL in professional settings. I just thought I'd switch it up. The database is currently hosted on my own computer. I probably won't push it up to the cloud for a while if I do do it. We'll see.

## Branches

If you don't see any other branches, that's because I haven't reached a point where I would need them. I am currently laying down the foundation of my app's functionality. Once I start adding features, I'll utilize branches.
